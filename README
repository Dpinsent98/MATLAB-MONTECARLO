A Monte Carlo Pricer is a computational technique used in quantitative finance for pricing financial instruments, particularly options and derivatives. 
It derives its name from the Monte Carlo method, a statistical simulation method that relies on random sampling to obtain numerical results.


Overview
This MATLAB project provides a Monte Carlo simulation-based approach for pricing different types of barrier options, including European Put Call, Down In, Down Out, Up In, Up Out, Double In, and Double Out options. 
The code uses a geometric Brownian motion model to simulate stock price paths and calculates option payoffs based on specific barrier conditions. The Arithmetic method and Sobol Sequence scripts implement variance reduction methods
in order to improve the accuracy of results.

Option Types
European Put Call
Down In
Down Out
Up In
Up Out
Double In
Double Out
For each option type, the code calculates option prices by simulating stock price paths and evaluating option payoffs according to the specified barrier conditions.

Simulation Parameters
Stock Price (S0): Initial price of the stock.
Volatility (V): Volatility of the stock.
Strike Price (K): Strike price of the option.
Barriers (H, U, L): Barrier levels for different types of barrier options.
Risk-Free Rate (r): Risk-free interest rate.
Maturity (T): Time to maturity.
Number of Paths (NoPath): Number of simulated paths.
Number of Monitoring Steps (NoSteps): Number of monitoring steps for each path.
Time Interval (TI): Time interval between monitoring steps.

Usage
Clone the repository:

Copy code
Open the MATLAB script (barrier_option_pricing.m) in MATLAB or any compatible MATLAB editor.
Customize simulation parameters as needed.
Run the script to obtain option prices.

Results
The script outputs the estimated prices for call (C) and put (P) options based on the specified barrier conditions and simulation parameters.
